Checklist for Maintenance of Safety Equipment

Hamburg, January 2014

0
Rev. 01/2014

Introduction
This overview by Germanischer Lloyd provides requirements and recommendations for maintenance and
inspection of safety equipment in a compact and practical tool for ship owners, operators and Surveyors. New
maintenance requirements for such equipment are published irregularly and in various IMO documents and
chapters which makes it cumbersome and time consuming to keep track of all changes. This list includes also
requirements and recommendations by Germanischer Lloyd.
Additional or more stringent requirements of manufacturers and the competent Administration are to be observed.

Procedure
Certain maintenance procedures and inspections may be performed by competent crew members, while others
shall be performed by specially trained persons. Which parts of the inspections and maintenance shall be
completed by competent crew members or specially trained persons is indicated in the list.

Precautions
As a general rule all inspections shall be carried out in accordance with the system manufacturer’s instructions and
safety precautions. If equipment is undergoing maintenance or testing then suitable arrangements shall be made
to ensure safety is not diminished through the provision of alternate equipment or other measures.

Records
Records of the inspections shall be carried on board of the ship, or may be computer-based. In cases where the
inspections and maintenance are carried out by specially trained persons other than the ship's crew, inspection
reports shall be provided upon the completion of the inspections. Some inspections required by SOLAS shall be
entered in the log-book.

system and flowing dry air or nitrogen from test cylinders or suitable means
through the piping.

MSC.1/Circ.1318, para. 6.1.3

Where possible, all activating heads shall be removed from the cylinder valves
and tested for correct functioning by applying full working pressure through the
pilot lines.
In cases where this is not possible, pilot lines shall be disconnected from the
cylinder valves and blanked off or connected together and tested with full working
pressure from the release station and checked for leakage.
In both cases this shall be carried out from one or more release stations when
installed.
If manual pull cables operate the remote release controls, they shall be checked
to verify the cables and corner pulleys are in good condition and freely move and
do not require an excessive amount of travel to activate the system.

MSC.1/Circ.1318, para. 6.2.1

All cable components should be cleaned and adjusted as necessary, and the
cable connectors shall be properly tightened. If the remote release controls are
operated by pneumatic pressure, the tubing shall be checked for leakage, and the
proper charge of the remote releasing station pilot gas cylinders shall be verified.
All controls and warning devices shall function normally, and the time delay, if
fitted shall prevent the discharge of gas for the required time period.

MSC.1/Circ.1318, para. 6.2.2

After completion of the work, the system shall be returned to service. All releasing
controls shall be verified in the proper position and connected to the correct
control valves. All pressure switch interlocks shall be reset and returned to
service. All stop valves shall be in the closed position.

MSC.1/Circ.1318, para. 6.2.3

High pressure cylinders shall be subjected to periodical tests at intervals not
exceeding 10 years. At the 10-year inspection, at least 10% of the total number
provided shall be subjected to an internal inspection and hydrostatic test. If one or
more cylinders fail, a total of 50% of the onboard cylinders shall be tested. If
further cylinders fail, all cylinders shall be tested.
