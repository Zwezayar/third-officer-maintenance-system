LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES
POCKET CHECKLIST
Reducing the risk of Port State Control detentions

In conjunction with:

Introduction
During the period 2005–2007, approximately 2,500 crew and
passengers were reported killed or missing from lost ships.
Additionally, there are increasing numbers of accidents and
fatalities during routine lifeboat and inspection drills. It is
therefore essential that ship personnel are appropriately
trained in how to inspect, maintain and operate equipment
and that the equipment is ready for use at all times.
Being prepared can mean the difference between lives lost or
lives saved.
In conjunction with an industry partner, the UK P&I Club, we
have analysed data relating to life-saving appliances, including
deficiencies found by Port State Control officers. The result is
this re-usable checklist, which highlights the most common
deficiencies and lists them in convenient sections.
As a minimum, the items on the chart on page 4 should
be included as part of your final checks prior to voyage
and port entry. It is strongly advised that all items in this
aide memoire are checked on an ongoing basis to
supplement your own operational and maintenance
procedures and your flag State’s requirements.
This is the third in a series of pocket checklists to help you
comply with international convention requirements. For
information about our other checklists please visit www.lr.org.

Lloyd’s Register, its affiliates and subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees
or agents are, individually and collectively, referred to in this clause as the ‘Lloyd's
Register Group’. The Lloyd's Register Group assumes no responsibility and shall not
be liable to any person for any loss, damage or expense caused by reliance on the
information or advice in this document or howsoever provided, unless that person
has signed a contract with the relevant Lloyd's Register Group entity for the provision
of this information or advice and in that case any responsibility or liability is
exclusively on the terms and conditions set out in that contract.

Are you prepared for a Port State
Control Inspection?
PSC officers always commence their inspection in the Master’s
office. It is essential that certification is up-to-date and valid.
All other necessary documents, records and manuals should,
where required, be approved and on board.
If equipment is broken or missing, or the ship has suffered
damage enroute, the Master must notify the port authorities
prior to port entry. If the port authorities are informed of the
problem and of any permanent or temporary remedies agreed
with the flag State, the vessel should not be detained.
However, if notice is not given before entry, the Port State has
clear grounds for inspection, possibly leading to a detention.
If your ship is detained, or appears to be in the process
of being detained, you should contact the nearest Lloyd’s
Register Group office immediately for assistance.
The major PSC organisations publish their criteria for targeting a
ship on their web sites. Ship owners and operators should use
these criteria to calculate the target rating of their ships.
Paris MOU - www.parismou.org
Tokyo MOU - www.tokyo-mou.org
USCG - http://homeport.uscg.mil/mycg/portal/ep/home.do
Other MOUs include Abuja, Black Sea, Caribbean, Indian
Ocean, Mediterranean, Riyadh and Vina del Mar.
A ship operator may disagree with the findings of the PSC
Authority and the majority of the regional PSC organisations
have guidelines on how to appeal against a detention. These
can also be found on the above web sites.
IMO Procedures for Port State Control, Appendix 1 also
provides guidelines on detentions [ISBN: 92-801-5099-5].
