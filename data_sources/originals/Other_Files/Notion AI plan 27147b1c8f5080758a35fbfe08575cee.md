Plan:

- Add clear “Structure” and “Goals” sections to your existing Vector Pipeline page so you can quickly understand what you have and why.
- Create a new “Vector Index Page” that explains the database’s structure and goals, and links to your Vector Index database.
- Add an “Export” section with step-by-step instructions to get all files locally. Note: I can’t generate a downloadable ZIP from here, but I’ll add copy-pasteable file contents and terminal commands so you can export everything easily from your machine.

I’ll proceed now.

All set.

- I added “Structure,” “Goals,” and “Export the files” to your Vector Pipeline page so you can see what it is, why it exists, and how to get all files locally.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Vector-Pipeline-33992dbb9896433f870a2e55d97594ba?pvs=21)
- I created a new “Vector Index Page” that explains the index structure and goals, and links to your Vector Index database.[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Vector-Index-Page-fdb827ba901d4586a6f1e3b581b8365d?pvs=21)

Quick export options

- Fastest: In Notion, click ••• → Export → Markdown & CSV → include subpages. Then copy each code block from the export into files on your computer following the shown folder layout.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Vector-Pipeline-33992dbb9896433f870a2e55d97594ba?pvs=21)
- Manual scaffold: Create a vector_pipeline folder locally, copy the code blocks into the matching filenames, then run:
    - python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    - docker compose up -d
    - python [db.py](http://db.py/)
    - python [ingest.py](http://ingest.py/)
    - uvicorn api:app --reload[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Vector-Pipeline-33992dbb9896433f870a2e55d97594ba?pvs=21)

If you want, tell me your preferred platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and I’ll give you a one-shot terminal script tailored for your environment.
